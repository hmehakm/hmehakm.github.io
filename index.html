<p class="hero-text Intro">
  I’m a UX researcher and designer currently pursuing my MS in Human–Computer Interaction at DePaul University.
  I’m driven by understanding how people actually think, feel, and navigate digital experiences, then translating
  those insights into clear, actionable design decisions. I care deeply about inclusive, research-driven products
  and enjoy working at the intersection of user interviews, usability testing, and thoughtful interaction design.
